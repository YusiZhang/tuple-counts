# tuple-counts

Data structure and API for summarizing the occurrences of event tuples.

## Usage

## Structure
Incoming tuples of the form `[action subject object timestamp]` are summarized into a nested data structure

```
{ subject
     { action
          { object [count timestamp] }
     }
} 
```

Where `count` is the count of occurrences so far and `timestamp` is the timestamp of the last recorded event.

## API
A Java interface is provided for the API, to support interoperability.
